                <p>
                    Research has found that more than 50 percent of people 
                    who start exercising as a New Year’s resolution end up 
                    quitting by summer. But are you really going to skip out 
                    on your yoga class if a friend is saving a mat for you 
                    at the studio? Experts say that exercise partners provide 
                    great motivation to adhere to workout goals.

                    Indeed, other research has shown that working out with a 
                    friend (even virtually) pushes people to keep at it longer 
                    than they would on their own.

                <p>
                    It’s easy to get caught in an exercise rut. But research 
                    from Scotland suggests that putting a friend into the mix 
                    can increase the amount of exercise you do. In a study 
                    published in April 2015 in the British Journal of Health 
                    Psychology, researchers found that the emotional support 
                    of someone you trust can serve as powerful reinforcement 
                    for fitness goals.

            <div>
                <h1 class="md">It’ll Help You Feel Less Stressed</h1>

                <p>
                    We often rely on family and friends to help us get through 
                    stressful periods in life. But a partner may also help 
                    alleviate stress in exercise environments. In a small 
                    study published November 2017 in the Journal of 
                    Osteopathic Medicine, group exercise participants reported 
                    a 26.2 percent reduction in perceived stress levels, which 
                    was more than study participants who exercised on their 
                    own. That’s in addition to the fact that exercise (with 
                    or without a friend) provides stress relief, pumps your 
                    body with feel-good endorphins, and improves your mood, 
                    according to the Mayo Clinic.

            <div>
                <h1 class="md">You’ll Push Yourself to Work Harder</h1>

                <p>
                    In a study published in Sport, Exercise, and Performance 
                    Psychology, researchers reviewed data from high school 
                    track relays and found that inferior athletes made greater 
                    gains compared with the top ones when everyone had to 
                    perform as part of a team. The researchers were looking 
                    to test the Köhler effect, a psychological theory that 
                    says motivation increases among individuals working in 
                    groups in comparison with individuals working alone, 
                    according to the American Psychological Association.

                    Other research shows this effect has also been seen in 
                    adults doing strength exercises; study participants worked 
                    harder (holding a plank position for longer) when working 
                    out with a partner than they did when doing planks on 
                    their own.
